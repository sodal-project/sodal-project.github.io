# The Basics

**Q1: So, what does Sodal do?**

Sodal's **Open Intelligence Platform** helps you **verify actors, predict actions, and improve outcomes.** We replace guesswork with verifiable proof by transforming behavioral data—like code commits or project activity—into intelligence for decisive action. Our first product, Scout, uses this platform to help teams hire proven developers based on what they've actually built, not just what their resume claims.

**Q2: What problem are you solving?**

We're solving the **crisis of digital trust.** Collaboration has outgrown its tools. Teams are drowning in signal overload, relying on broken trust proxies like resumes that are easily faked, and facing new risks from AI agents. This creates a world of guesswork where high-stakes decisions about who to hire, trust, and partner with are made on unreliable information, leading to inefficiency and risk.

**Q3: Who is your customer?**

Our immediate customer for our first product, Scout, is anyone hiring technical talent—from recruiters and hiring managers at startups to engineering leads at large enterprises.

More broadly, our platform is for any decision-maker who needs to **verify actors and predict actions** to achieve a goal. This includes security practitioners managing access, community managers fostering engagement, and open-source projects coordinating with contributors.

# Product & Technology

**Q4: What exactly is the "Open Intelligence Platform"?**

It's the new, foundational infrastructure we're building. It's an open, composable system that ingests behavioral data from many sources and transforms it into a unified, contextualized model of what an actor - human or AI - can do and is likely to do. It's not another SaaS app; it's the underlying source of truth that powers our `Verify, Predict, Improve` framework.

**Q5: How is this different from a background check or a skills assessment tool?**

Those tools operate on **claims and artificial environments.** Background checks verify static claims from the past. Skills tests see if someone can solve a puzzle in a sandbox.

Our platform operates on **real-world, continuous proof.** We answer a more powerful question: "What has this person or system *actually done* in their natural environment?" It's the difference between reading a resume and watching a highlight reel of their last two years of work.

**Q6: What is "Agentic Modeling"? Is that your secret sauce?**

Yes, Agentic Modeling is the engine that powers our platform. It's our method for making sense of behavior. This framework is how we:

- **Verify actors** by modeling their **Identity** and **Capability**.
- **Predict actions** by modeling their **Behavior** based on past actions.
- **Improve outcomes** by translating this intelligence into **Confidence** for decisive action.

This unified approach is what allows us to analyze both humans and AI in a consistent, powerful way.

# Market & Go-to-Market Strategy

**Q7: Why start with recruiting and GitHub?**

We're following a classic "wedge" strategy. Technical recruiting is a **massive, universal, and high-pain problem.** Finding the right talent is incredibly expensive and time-consuming, and the cost of a bad hire is enormous. GitHub provides a rich, public source of behavioral data.

By solving this acute pain point first with Scout, we can deliver immediate, measurable ROI to customers, generate revenue, and build out our core **Intelligence Platform** with real-world validation.

**Q8: How big is this market?**

Our wedge market, HR Tech, is over $40 billion. However, our vision extends far beyond that. Our platform is foundational technology applicable to the Cybersecurity market ($200B+), Data Intelligence, and the emerging market for AI governance. We are creating a new category, and our true market is the total value of all digital collaborations that require trust.

**Q9: What's your long-term defensibility? What's the moat?**

Our moat is not a single feature; it's the **ecosystem we build on our platform.** While Scout is our initial product, our long-term moat is the Sodal Marketplace. As third parties contribute new datasets and build new analytical modules on our open core, they create powerful network effects. We become the indispensable platform that orchestrates the market, turning fragmented data exhaust into a shared, continuously improving map of digital trust. Competitors can copy a feature, but they can't copy the ecosystem.

# The Business

**Q10: How do you make money?**

Our model evolves in three stages:

1. **Near-Term:** Direct SaaS revenue from our own applications, starting with Cartographer Scout.
2. **Mid-Term:** API access and premium features for enterprises who want to integrate our platform into their own systems.
3. **Long-Term:** A multi-sided marketplace model with transaction fees for third-party modules and data, creating non-linear, high-margin revenue growth.

**Q11: Who are your competitors? What if LinkedIn or Microsoft builds this?**

Our competitors fall into two camps: legacy tools like background checkers, which are built on a flawed premise, and point solutions like skills tests, which are too narrow.

A large incumbent like Microsoft/LinkedIn could try to build this, but they face a fundamental disadvantage: **business model misalignment.** Their value comes from creating walled gardens around proprietary data. Our value comes from creating an open, interoperable ecosystem. Our open-core model is a strategic advantage that aligns us with the future of development and makes us a more trusted, neutral platform.

**Q12: Why are you the right founder to build this?**

This company is the culmination of my entire career. I spent decades in the US defense and blockchain communities building systems to establish trust and assess capabilities in high-stakes, zero-trust environments. I've lived this problem from every angle—technical, human, and strategic. I have deep expertise in the core technologies and a fundamental understanding of what it takes to build systems that enable safe, effective collaboration.
