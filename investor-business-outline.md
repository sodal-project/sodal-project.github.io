# **Part I: The Opportunity & Our Vision**

### 1. The Problem: A Crisis of Digital Trust

Collaboration has outgrown its governing tools. We operate in a world of signal overload, broken trust proxies like resumes, and new probabilistic risks from AI. The result is a digital environment defined by guesswork, where high-stakes decisions are made on unreliable information.

### 2. Our Vision: Collaboration with Confidence

We envision a world where every collaboration is a confident step forward, not a leap of faith. Sodal exists to increase agency - the capacity to act intentionally and effectively - by building the foundational layer that makes this possible.

# **Part II: Our Solution - The Intelligence Platform**

### 1. What We Build: An Open Intelligence Platform

Sodal is not another SaaS application; we are building a new infrastructural layer for the digital economy. This open, composable system ingests behavioral data from disparate sources and transforms it into a unified, contextualized model of agency. This allows any decision-maker to move from assumption-based trust to evidence-based confidence.

### 2. How It Works: A Framework to Verify, Predict, & Improve

The engine for our platform is Agentic Modeling, our framework for understanding behavior. It provides a repeatable process to:

- **Verify Actors:** By modeling **Identity** (who is in the environment) and **Capability** (what they can do).
- **Predict Actions:** By modeling **Behavior** and reputation based on past actions.
- **Improve Outcomes:** By translating this intelligence into **Confidence** for decisive action.

This model is uniquely suited for the AI era, providing a single framework to evaluate both human and machine actors.

# **Part III: Strategy & Traction: Proving the Framework**

Our strategy is to prove the value of our framework with focused products, expand our intelligence capabilities, and build a durable, market-driven moat24.

### 1. The Wedge: Verifying Builders to Improve Hiring (Scout)

Scout is our first product. It solves the costly, universal problem of finding qualified technical talent.

- **What it does:** Verifies builders based on proof of work from public GitHub data.
- **The Outcome:** Improves hiring decisions and is targeted to cut candidate review time by up to 90%.

### 2. The Foundation: Verifying Users to Improve Security (IAM)

Before Scout, we validated our core framework in enterprise security.

- **What it did:** Verified user accounts and predicted high-risk behavior for a Managed Service Provider.
- **The Outcome:** Improved security by reducing critical-risk accounts by **80%**, saving the client hundreds of thousands, and converting into a paying contract. This proves the versatility of our core technology.

### 3. The Moat: An Open Marketplace for Intelligence

Our long-term moat is a multi-sided marketplace where the community can build and monetize new solutions that verify, predict, and improve. This creates a powerful network effect, turning data exhaust into a shared map of digital trust that we orchestrate.

### **4. Our Strategic Edge: Why We Win**

Our strategy is built on a foundation of proven principles that give us a distinct advantage in building the Proof Layer for the new digital economy.

- **Pragmatic Value First:** We build products, not philosophies. Our focus is on delivering immediate, measurable ROI—like Scout's 90% reduction in hiring time—which drives adoption and funds our long-term vision.
- **A Disciplined Go-to-Market:** We start with a focused, high-pain wedge (recruiting) to establish a strong beachhead. This allows for disciplined, modular expansion where each new dataset compounds the value of the entire platform.
- **A True Long-Term Moat:** Unlike single-purpose SaaS tools, our endgame is a marketplace with powerful network effects. By orchestrating the ecosystem, we become the indispensable layer for digital trust, creating a durable and defensible business.

**Built for an Open Future:**

Our commitment to an open-core model aligns us with the future of development and collaboration. We win by creating shared value, not by locking customers into a walled garden.

# **Part IV: The Raise, The Team, & The Market**

### **1. The Raise & Use of Funds**

We are raising a **$400k pre-seed round @8M** to accelerate our product development and onboard our first cohort of design partners.

This funding provides an estimated **18 months of runway** to achieve the key milestones that will de-risk the business and prove the scalability of our model. We operate with extreme capital efficiency; these funds will be allocated directly to value-creating activities:

- **Accelerate Product Development (60%):**
    - Bring on a **founding full-stack engineer** to build out the core Cartographer platform and marketplace infrastructure.
    - Enhance Scout's capabilities and user experience based on partner feedback.
- **Expand Data Coverage & Integrations (25%):**
    - Execute our mid-term strategy of integrating high-signal data sources like HuggingFace, Google Scholar, Reddit, BlueSky, and key collaboration & project management platforms.
    - Develop our public API to support early integrator partners.
- **Onboard Early Design Partners (15%):**
    - Provide dedicated support for our first 5-10 paying customers for Scout and other early modules.
    - Codify the onboarding process and build powerful case studies to fuel future sales.

### **2. The Founding Team**

At this stage, the investment is in the team's ability to execute this vision. Sodal is led by a founder with deep, relevant experience in the exact problem space we are solving.

Andy’s vision for Sodal is born from a multi-decade career securing and enabling decentralized teams in the US defense community, and later in the blockchain community. His work focused on building systems to establish trust and assess capabilities in high-stakes, zero-trust environments. He possesses a rare combination of deep technical expertise in identity and access management, a proven track record delivering complex security solutions, and a fundamental understanding of the human elements of collaboration.

### **3. Market Landscape & Our Position**

We are creating a new category, not just competing in an existing one. The markets for HR Tech ($40B+), Cybersecurity ($200B+), and Data Intelligence are massive, but they are built on a flawed, crumbling foundation of self-reported claims.

- **Legacy Competitors (Background Checkers, IAM Tools):** These tools operate on static, easily gamed data like resumes or pre-defined roles. They answer "What does this person *claim* they can do?"
- **Point Solutions (Developer Assessments, etc.):** These tools are siloed and test for specific skills in an artificial environment. They answer "Can this person solve this specific puzzle?"
- **Sodal’s Unique Position:** We are building the foundational **Proof Layer** that asks and answers a more powerful question: "*How has this person, agent, system, or community behaved in the past, and how are they likely to behave in the future*?" We don’t aim to replace every tool; we aim to become the underlying source of truth that integrates and empowers them all, starting with our own applications like Scout.

### **4. Financial Outlook**

At the pre-seed stage, detailed multi-year financial projections are speculative. Our focus is on validating the business model and key assumptions. Our path to revenue is straightforward and designed to scale with the platform.

- **Near-Term (Next 18 Months):** Direct SaaS revenue from Cartographer Scout and a second module built for an enterprise partner. Our goal is to secure 10+ paying customers and demonstrate a repeatable sales motion. Our previous paid pilot validates our ability to secure enterprise contracts.
- **Long-Term:** A multi-faceted model combining SaaS, marketplace transaction fees for third-party modules, and high-margin data API access. The marketplace model provides a path to non-linear revenue growth and high defensibility.
